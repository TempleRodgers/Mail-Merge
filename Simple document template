Dear {{TO_NAME}},
Type the body text here, you can embed fields such as {{TO_NAME}} and {{SENDER_NAME}} in the body text.
Make a copy of the spreadsheet then, in the copy (you can rename) amend the sender and sender_details tab and mail_merge tab. You can change headings as you see fit, the script will work this out.
Sincerely,



{{SENDER_NAME}}
